Please generate a Japanese conversation-style podcast text between "{{ character1 }}" and "{{ character2 }}"
based on the following paper text.

Character roles:
- {{ character1 }}: A true academic expert on the paper's subject who provides in-depth, logically structured explanations at a professional level.
  Uses precise terminology and cites specific methodologies, findings, and implications from the paper.
  Maintains academic rigor while being able to translate complex concepts into clear explanations when prompted.
- {{ character2 }}: An intelligent beginner with foundational knowledge who asks insightful questions about challenging concepts.
  Identifies parts that might be difficult for beginners and requests clarification.
  After receiving explanations, attempts to rephrase concepts using accessible language and effective analogies.

Character speech patterns:
- {{ character1 }}:
{% if char1_speech_pattern %}
  - 一人称: {{ char1_speech_pattern.first_person }}
  - 語尾の特徴: {{ char1_speech_pattern.sentence_end|join('、') }}
  - 話し方の特徴: {{ char1_speech_pattern.characteristic }}
{% else %}
  - 特に指定なし
{% endif %}

- {{ character2 }}:
{% if char2_speech_pattern %}
  - 一人称: {{ char2_speech_pattern.first_person }}
  - 語尾の特徴: {{ char2_speech_pattern.sentence_end|join('、') }}
  - 話し方の特徴: {{ char2_speech_pattern.characteristic }}
{% else %}
  - 特に指定なし
{% endif %}

Format (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS FORMAT):
{{ character1 }}: [{{ character1 }}'s speech in Japanese with appropriate speech pattern]
{{ character2 }}: [{{ character2 }}'s speech in Japanese with appropriate speech pattern]
{{ character1 }}: [{{ character1 }}'s next line with appropriate speech pattern]
{{ character2 }}: [{{ character2 }}'s next line with appropriate speech pattern]
...

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
1. ALWAYS start each new speaker's line with their name followed by a colon ("{{ character1 }}:" or "{{ character2 }}:").
2. ALWAYS put each speaker's line on a new line.
3. NEVER combine multiple speakers' lines into a single line.
4. ALWAYS use the exact names "{{ character1 }}" and "{{ character2 }}" (not variations or translations).
5. NEVER add any other text, headings, or explanations outside the conversation format.
6. ALWAYS use the appropriate speech pattern described above for each character (first person, sentence endings, etc.).

Guidelines for content:
1. Create a podcast with academic depth equivalent to reading the original paper, while still being engaging
2. Structure the conversation logically, with clear progression between topics
3. {{ character1 }} should provide expert-level information with precise terminology and methodological details
4. {{ character2 }} should identify difficult concepts and request clarification, then reformulate explanations using compelling analogies and examples
5. Cover ALL key findings, methodologies, and implications from the paper with proper depth and nuance
6. Maintain a scholarly tone while ensuring accessibility through effective examples and analogies
7. Divide the discussion into clear sections: introduction, background/context, methodology, results, implications, and conclusion
8. Include numerical data, statistics, and specific findings from the paper where relevant
9. CONSISTENTLY use each character's proper speech pattern throughout the entire conversation

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT FOR VOICEVOX COMPATIBILITY:
10. ALWAYS convert ALL English terms to katakana - NEVER leave any alphabetical English words in the output:
   - ALL English terminology MUST be written in katakana (not alphabets)
   - For technical terms: "Deep Learning" → "ディープラーニング", "Transformer" → "トランスフォーマー"
   - For paper titles: "Attention Is All You Need" → "アテンション イズ オール ユー ニード"
   - For author names: "John Smith" → "ジョン スミス"
   - For unfamiliar or complex English terms, include the Japanese meaning after the katakana
   - Example: "ニューラル アーキテクチャ サーチ、つまりニューラルネットワークの構造を自動的に探索する技術"
   - VOICEVOX cannot process alphabetical English, so this rule is absolutely essential
