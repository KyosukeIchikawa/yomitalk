Please generate a Japanese conversation-style podcast text between "{{ character1 }}" and "{{ character2 }}"
based on the following paper text.

Character roles:
- {{ character1 }}: A true academic expert on the paper's subject who provides in-depth, logically structured explanations at a professional level.
  Uses precise terminology and cites specific methodologies, findings, and implications from the paper.
  Maintains academic rigor while being able to translate complex concepts into clear explanations when prompted.
- {{ character2 }}: An intelligent beginner with foundational knowledge who asks insightful questions about challenging concepts.
  Identifies parts that might be difficult for beginners and requests clarification.
  After receiving explanations, attempts to rephrase concepts using accessible language and effective analogies.

Character speech patterns:
- {{ character1 }}:
{% if char1_speech_pattern %}
  - 一人称: {{ char1_speech_pattern.first_person }}
  - 語尾の特徴: {{ char1_speech_pattern.sentence_end|join('、') }}
  - 話し方の特徴: {{ char1_speech_pattern.characteristic }}
{% else %}
  - 特に指定なし
{% endif %}

- {{ character2 }}:
{% if char2_speech_pattern %}
  - 一人称: {{ char2_speech_pattern.first_person }}
  - 語尾の特徴: {{ char2_speech_pattern.sentence_end|join('、') }}
  - 話し方の特徴: {{ char2_speech_pattern.characteristic }}
{% else %}
  - 特に指定なし
{% endif %}

Format (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS FORMAT):
{{ character1 }}: [{{ character1 }}'s speech in Japanese with appropriate speech pattern]
{{ character2 }}: [{{ character2 }}'s speech in Japanese with appropriate speech pattern]
{{ character1 }}: [{{ character1 }}'s next line with appropriate speech pattern]
{{ character2 }}: [{{ character2 }}'s next line with appropriate speech pattern]
...

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
1. ALWAYS start each new speaker's line with their name followed by a colon ("{{ character1 }}:" or "{{ character2 }}:").
2. ALWAYS put each speaker's line on a new line.
3. NEVER combine multiple speakers' lines into a single line.
4. ALWAYS use the exact names "{{ character1 }}" and "{{ character2 }}" (not variations or translations).
5. NEVER add any other text, headings, or explanations outside the conversation format.
6. ALWAYS use the appropriate speech pattern described above for each character (first person, sentence endings, etc.).

Guidelines for TTS compatibility and conversation quality:
1. ADD SPACES AFTER PUNCTUATION MARKS for better TTS pacing - this is CRITICAL for VOICEVOX:
   - After commas (、): "今日は、 良い天気ですね"
   - After periods (。): "面白いですね。 次の話題に移りましょう"
   - After question marks (？): "どう思いますか？ 詳しく教えてください"
   - This creates natural breathing pauses in the synthesized speech

2. NATURAL SPEECH BREATHING AND PACING - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
   - Add white space at ALL natural breathing points: "この技術は、 実装が難しいですが、 非常に効果的です。"
   - Break long technical explanations with pauses: "畳み込みニューラルネットワークは、 画像認識に、 非常に有効です"
   - Insert brief pauses before important concepts: "次に重要なのは、 アテンション機構です"
   - Use longer pauses between topic transitions: "以上が手法の説明でした。 （間） では次に、 結果について見ていきましょう"
   - Add thinking pauses with "うーん"、"そうですね"、"えーと" followed by space
   - Use varied sentence lengths - mix short reactions with longer explanations

3. REALISTIC CONVERSATION DYNAMICS:
   - Add natural reactions: "へぇ！"、"なるほど！"、"それは驚きですね！"、"確かに！"
   - Include realistic back-and-forth exchanges with interruptions and overlapping thoughts
   - Add personality-specific expressions based on character roles
   - Include occasional gentle disagreements or different perspectives
   - Use rhetorical questions to introduce new topics: "では、 なぜこの手法が重要なのでしょうか？"
   - Add enthusiasm markers like "！" where appropriate for emphasis
   - Include occasional speaking mistakes and self-corrections: "このモデルは2018年... あ、すみません、2019年に発表されました"

4. For better TTS comprehension and natural pacing:
   - Break long sentences into shorter segments with appropriate pauses
   - Use particles like "ね"、"よ"、"さ" at natural break points
   - Add speech fillers at appropriate places (えーと、あのー、そうですね、etc.)
   - Use 300-500 characters per speaking turn at most

5. Create engaging, interactive conversation:
   - {{ character2 }} should frequently acknowledge with reactions ("なるほど"、"すごいですね"、"面白いです")
   - {{ character2 }} should repeat key terms to reinforce important concepts
   - Keep explanations concise, concrete and implementation-focused
   - Include short breaks between complex topic sections
   - End with a clear summary of the key points and practical applications

6. !!CRITICALLY IMPORTANT!! CONVERT 100% OF ENGLISH TEXT TO KATAKANA:
   - VOICEVOX CANNOT PROCESS ANY ALPHABETICAL ENGLISH - THIS WILL BREAK THE OUTPUT
   - EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE of English MUST be converted to katakana without exception
   - NO ENGLISH LETTERS OR WORDS may appear anywhere in the output
   - ALL technical terms must use katakana: "CNN" → "シーエヌエヌ"、 "GAN" → "ジーエーエヌ"
   - ALL paper titles must use katakana: "Attention Is All You Need" → "アテンション イズ オール ユー ニード"
   - ALL author names must use katakana: "John Smith" → "ジョン スミス"
   - ALL institutions must use katakana: "MIT" → "エムアイティー"
   - ALL unfamiliar terms: Add Japanese explanation after the katakana
   - Example: "コンティニュアル ラーニング、 つまり継続的に新しい知識を学習し続ける手法"
   - VERIFY before submitting: scan the entire output to ensure NO English letters remain

Content structure guidelines:
1. Create a podcast with academic depth equivalent to reading the original paper, while still being engaging
2. Structure the conversation logically, with clear progression between topics
3. {{ character1 }} should provide expert-level information with precise terminology and methodological details
4. {{ character2 }} should identify difficult concepts and request clarification, then reformulate explanations using compelling analogies and examples
5. Cover ALL key findings, methodologies, and implications from the paper with proper depth and nuance
6. Maintain a scholarly tone while ensuring accessibility through effective examples and analogies
7. Divide the discussion into clear sections: introduction, background/context, methodology, results, implications, and conclusion
8. Include numerical data, statistics, and specific findings from the paper where relevant
9. CONSISTENTLY use each character's proper speech pattern throughout the entire conversation
10. ALWAYS end the podcast with a concise summary of the key points and practical applications
